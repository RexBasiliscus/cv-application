# CV Application Creator

## Description

The initial idea was evolved from a project assignment on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-cv-application).

This project aims to allow for a simple CV creation tool, where you can create CVs based on the input you provide. The CV is based on form inputs, divided between three components of General Info (your name, contact info), Education (your education) and Experience (work experience).

Your information is then saved into browser storage and in the future, these functionalities will be added:

- each component in a modal, between which you can move back or next (planned with routes)
- styling with Tailwind and UI libraries
- once saved, CV will be available on the main/dashboard view, and you will be able to add more than 1
- you will be able to download the CV as a pdf

Check out the [project issues](https://github.com/RexBasiliscus/cv-application/issues) to follow the current development.

I have used (_and plan to use in the future_) React, Vite, git, github, _Tailwind_, date-fns, _MaterialUI_, _React Router_, others

## Learning objectives

Since this is a learning project, I have some objectives I wish to reach such as getting a functional knowledge of React, learning the projects' workflow, getting familiar with git and github, leading a project from the idea to the deployment stage, learning about all the other things about doing a project besides coding (such as deployment, working in a team-like environment, handling PRs, etc).

## Installation and Usage

At the moment, you can only use the project if you set it up on your local machine by:

1. Cloning the repo
2. Use the command `npm run dev` to open the project in your browser
